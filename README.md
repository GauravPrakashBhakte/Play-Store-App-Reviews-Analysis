Exploratory Data Analysis 

The Play Store Data is first extracted and then categorized to identify , analyze
behavior data and patterns . Using this dataset in our EDA project we found
some relevant analysis which would help playstore to perform better.
As the first step, we perform Data Cleaning over the dataset. Further we
divided our project in Five main parts i.e Analysis on Play Store Data and
Reviews Data,Analysis based on Cancellations, General Analysis, Distribution of
App Rating, Data Visualization .
The objective of this project is to deliver insights to understand customer

dataset is chosen from Kaggle
Discussion of Google play store dataset will involve various steps such as:

 Loading the data into data frame
 Cleaning the data
 Extracting statistics from the dataset
 Exploratory analysis and visualizations
 Questions that can be asked from the dataset

That's how we have accomplished our team work in Play Store Data Analysis
